# Git. by fdhasna21
Git. is a GitHub user search app for searching and displaying github user details, such as profile information, followings, followers, repositories, and starred repositories, based on GitHub REST API. Git.'s user can share profile information of the chosen Github user. This app is also combined with a local database to store the history of GitHub users whose details have been viewed. Git.'s user can choose the language they want to use in this app, between English and Indonesian, via device language settings connected to this app. As a token of gratitude, I add the credit in the About Me section along with my contact person so users can easily contact me if they need. 

## Technology Used

1.  MVVM Architecture with Repository and Koin Injection
